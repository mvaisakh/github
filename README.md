# **WECOME TO MY GUIDE TO GITHUB**

_**This guide is for those people who don't know how to use github or any other git websites.**_
_**Especially for those who want to maintain android roms but are not able to understand github.**_

So Let's **Begin**!

### **Before We Begin**

I just hope you have these basic things:

  1. **A github account (Mandatory)**
  
  2. **A linux machine**

  3. **A friggin brain**

**Since you've read this till here. I assume you've all this. So now let's actually begin**

**Head to the [Wiki](https://github.com/mvaisakh/github/wiki/So,-The-Starting.)**

If you have any doubts/issues, feel free to open up issues on this repo, comment on any page or commits.
Likewise, if you are an Android developer, and want to ask doubts to me in person, then tag me with @mvaisakh in the Telegram group [Android ROM Developer Chat](https://t.me/android_builders_help). But I will not respond to personal queries or personal messages (Because lot of spams, hope you understand) and also I find the group a better means of communicating.
